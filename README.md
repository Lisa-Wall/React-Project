# React-Project

A sandbox for me to play around with React.

For development, build and deploy I'm using Vite.

The code is hosted here: (https://lcchomes.com/other/react/dist/).

## Contents

A bunch of code snippets + code running live, plus my notes.

The best way to see it is to go to the link above and scroll through the examples.
