* JSX
* Props
* State
* Hooks

The best way to see it is to go to the link above and scroll through.

## What it is not
 This is not an installation guide nor an exhaustive course. It's a quick introduction to React, meant to be a springboard into other resources, of which there are many excellent ones online. 

 ## Taking it Further

 Here are some resources I can personally recommend for learning React:
 * W3Schools has a comprehensive React tutorial [https://www.w3schools.com/react/]
 * I HIGHLY recommend this tutorial by independent developer Joubran Jad. It's simply excellent. The topics are presented in just the right order and speed, and it's interactive, so you get to try everything out at every step right on the platform. This course clearly incorporates the science of how we learn and retain information. And... it's really FUN too! Link: https://react-tutorial.app/
